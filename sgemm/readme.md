- sgemm0: naive
- sgemm1: using shared memory to cache global memory, each thread is responsible for a location of C
- sgemm2: using register to cache shared memory, each thread is responsible for RM*RN location of C
- sgemm3: using vector instruction (float4)
- sgemm4: double buffering
- sgemm5: remove shared memory bank conflic
